The first project is the research project that I did in my freshman year. I didn't know a lot about the programming practice and I cram everyting into one file. Also I didn't use any programming method such as OOP and I have multiple functions doing repetitive work

The second project is a class project that I did in one of my programming classes. The goal of the project is create a SQL using C++. In the project, I have use proper OOP concept and also create many test cases for testing my program instead of manually testing in the research project that I did
